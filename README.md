# Code-Refactor
In this webpage, I have incorporated semantic HTML for non-semantic for an easier understanding of how the code is laid out. I have included a header tag and nested within that is a nav tag. The nav tag has links nested inside that will take you to the specific part of the webpage that you want to view. I have also included a descriptive title tag so the viewer can understand the content of the webpage even before they start browsing,

I have included two section tags, one has nested article tags and the other has nested aside tags. I chose aside tags for one section because my webpage has an area to the right side of the browser that stores information. I wanted other developers to clearly understand that the specifc information in that section needs to be positioned to the right. 

Inside of both section tags, I have nested figure tags. Nested inside the figure tags i have img elements with alt descriptions of the picture.
